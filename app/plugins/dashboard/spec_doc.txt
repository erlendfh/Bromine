-- model:
Should somehow ensure that you can't fetch data you don't have access to or do something nasty with the sql (like nuking the db)

-- controller:
fetches all data in dahsboard_personals on user_id
loops through each data (each represents a div), executes sql and populates sql field with returned data

-- view:
view loops through each data{
    case/switch on [Personal][type] handles the data in [Personal][sql]
    eg. 'pie' expects array('name'=>number,'name'=>number) breaks if not.
    eg. 'table' expects array('header1','header2',array(array('data11','data12'),array('data21','data22'))) breaks if not.
}

settings tab on each div give access to the sql text area
sidepanel containing all types, drag 'n drop onto canvas to add divs
ability to unlock/lock dashboard. revealing/hiding settings tab, and sidepanel, enabling/disabling resizing and repositioning
